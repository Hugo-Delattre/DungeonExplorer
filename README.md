Welcome to the T-JAVA-501 2D Game project by Nina Girard and Hugo Delattre.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run DesktopLauncher.java, located in T-WEB-501\desktop\src\com.dungeon.explorer

## How to play

Your goal is to reach the end of the dungeon as fast as you can.

Eliminate all opponents in a room to move on to the next room.
Keep an eye on the timer, and try to get the best time possible!
